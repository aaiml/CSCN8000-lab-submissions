This is the repository to which the CSCN8000 practical labs are submitted to in the first part of the course (up to the student success week).

Setup

1. Fork this repository (this is critical, as it will allow you to push your submissions to Github)

2. Clone the forked repository to your local computer (git clone REPO-URL, where REPO-URL is the URL of the forked 
    repository)
  
3. Follow the instruction in Student Submission Subfolder Setup

4. Commit and push your updates to your forked repository on Github

5. Note, you can use the same environment as CSCN8000, so no need to create another one
